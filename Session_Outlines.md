# Setting

It's a late Spring Thursday in the small midwestern town of Maple Yard. College students are not yet back for the summer, but high school students are out. The town has...
* The Jergers' Maple grove: owned by the wealthy Jerger family, this orchard produces syrup
* Gods Hand: a cliffy outcropping just outside of town that is called such because it looks like a fist giving the 'thumbs up'. Known as a popular makeout spot among high schoolers. Also the site of disappearance(s?)
* Culvers: Culvers
* St. Doms: Catholic church
* Sheriff station: Goodman's office is usually tidy. In the waiting room they have issues of Ranger Rick and "sports newspapers"
* Ranger place &trade; aka "ranger's hovel" or cabin

# Session One Narrative

## Thursday

### Barry
Barry receives a visit from his regional manager.
A taller, middle aged man with glasses, Will Csivel informs Barry that he needs to bring down the costs by finding a way to cut hours.

A newer employee Brian Masterson fails to show up for work.
Barry asks Billy Billyson if he knows anything about this (or was this Friday?)

### Lisa

On this particular Thursday she is supervising the maple grove.
It isn't tapping season and all that needs doing is maintenence of the trees.
She leans against a tree and journals about her day in a cypher.
In the afternoon she overhears workers Jim and John talking about another missing person.
This is the first disappearance that Lisa has been in town for. 

### Quincy

## Friday

## Saturday

### Morning
The three adventurers decided to meet for breakfast at the local restaurant *Jedi Garden*. There they laboriously navigated social interactions with the waitress Carol. 

After breakfest the ventured to the Sheriff's office to figure out if Goodman had learned anything. An exhausted Sheriff Goodman in his freshly messy office let them know nothing of interest was learned. But our adventurers snuck looks at the paperwork strewn over his desk. It showed many old case files regarding disappearances, many given the cause of animal attack and labeled either dogs or bear.

In the most recent case the detective at the time insisted it was a reptile attack. 

Sheriff Goodman is advised to look for a pair of jeans at the rocky outcrop and the adventurers depart. 

### Ranger Marky Mark

Ranger mark hasn't seen any usual owl activity and yellow salamanders are native to these parts. 

The tooth: Some kind of reptile. Most likely South American, the size of an alligator, upon closer look there is a small opening where venom would be stored.

Ranger Mark is aware Quincy was examining his reactions to the tooth in a semi-suspicious manner. 

The egg: He is genuinely surprised at its existance. A flashlight isn't strong enough to see any fetus, but a stronger light reveals it is fertilized. 

### Gods Hand

Deputy Trevor is a kill joy and says we can't cross the police tape. We search the strange shrub, there is a hatch underneath. 

Goodman is at the plateau and is taking pictures. 

### Marky Mark Mark2

The incisor is closest to a Komodo Dragon. It would need a warmer place to sleep than Maple Yard would provide, but the cave would work. A komodo dragon could physically climb a ladder but is too dumb to do so. The poison is a potent neurotoxin. The best remedy without an antidote is to immediately cut off blood supply.
