# Setting

It's a late Spring Thursday in the small midwestern town of Maple Yard. College students are not yet back for the summer, but high school students are out. The town has...
* The Jergers' Maple grove: owned by the wealthy Jerger family, this orchard produces syrup
* Gods Hand: a cliffy outcropping just outside of town that is called such because it looks like a fist giving the 'thumbs up'. Known as a popular makeout spot among high schoolers. Also the site of disappearance(s?)
* Culvers: Culvers
* St. Doms: Catholic church

Wears a punked out letterman jacket and carries a skateboard because he can't afford a car. Has a backpack and bat for protection. 

## Lisa Lovelace
Parents are from town and were conspiracy theorists from an island. Also are dead. She works in the Jergers' maple grove

A regular at Culvers, Lisa is on friendly terms with Barry (who understands the importance of stellar customer service).
He knows her "usual". 

She knows Quincy from various fundraises throughout town and originally disliked him. She holds no strong religious views.
She asserts that humans do not have an innate sense of right and wrong, and that they operate in shades of grey. 

Owns a scary axe.

## Quincy

Quincy wants to help Barry help himself. He sees Barry's potential as a pivotal community figure and role model to the town's youth.
Quincy, while not above trying to evangelize the non-religious Barry, focuses on being supportive and friendly in the hope of sparking some curiosity in him. 

Owns a silver dagger and 9 mm pistol.

### Barry
Barry receives a visit from his regional manager.
A taller, middle aged man with glasses, Will Csivel informs Barry that he needs to bring down the costs by finding a way to cut hours.

A newer employee Brian Masterson fails to show up for work.
Barry asks Billy Billyson if he knows anything about this (or was this Friday?)

### Lisa

On this particular Thursday she is supervising the maple grove.
It isn't tapping season and all that needs doing is maintenence of the trees.
She leans against a tree and journals about her day in a cypher.
In the afternoon she overhears workers Jim and John talking about another missing person.
This is the first disappearance that Lisa has been in town for.
