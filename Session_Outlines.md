## Lisa Lovelace
Parents are from out of town and were conspiracy theorists from an island. Also are dead. She works in the Jergers' maple grove

A regular at Culvers, Lisa is on friendly terms with Barry (who understands the importance of stellar customer service).
He knows her "usual". 

She knows Quincy from various fundraises throughout town.
She originally disliked him, as she holds no strong religious views.
She asserts that humans do not have an innate sense of right and wrong, and that they operate in shades of grey. 

On this particular Thursday she is supervising the maple grove.
It isn't tapping season and all that needs doing is maintenence of the trees.
She leans against a tree and journals about her day in a cypher.
In the afternoon she overhears workers Jim and John talking about another missing person.
This is the first disappearance that Lisa has been in town for. 


## Quincy

Quincy wants to help Barry help himself. He sees Barry's potential as a pivotal community figure and role model to the town's youth.
Quincy, while not above trying to evangelize the non-religious Barry, focuses on being supportive and friendly in the hope of sparking some curiosity in him.
