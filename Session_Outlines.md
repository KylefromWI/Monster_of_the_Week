# Setting

It's a late Spring Thursday in the small midwestern town of Maple Yard. College students are not yet back for the summer, but high school students are out. The town has...
* The Jergers' Maple grove: owned by the wealthy Jerger family, this orchard produces syrup
* Gods Hand: a cliffy outcropping just outside of town that is called such because it looks like a fist giving the 'thumbs up'. Known as a popular makeout spot among high schoolers. Also the site of disappearance(s?)
* Culvers: Culvers
* St. Doms: Catholic church
* Sheriff station: Goodman's office is usually tidy. In the waiting room they have issues of Ranger Rick and "sports newspapers"
* Ranger place &trade; aka "ranger's hovel" or cabin

She asserts that humans do not have an innate sense of right and wrong, and that they operate in shades of grey. 

Owns a scary axe.

## Quincy

Quincy wants to help Barry help himself. He sees Barry's potential as a pivotal community figure and role model to the town's youth.
Quincy, while not above trying to evangelize the non-religious Barry, focuses on being supportive and friendly in the hope of sparking some curiosity in him.
